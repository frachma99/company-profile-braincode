        Develop a solution  for your company or organization ( ERP system ). Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) is the integrated management of core business processes, often in real-time and mediated by software and technology.

    <p>
        ERP is usually referred to as a category of business-management software — typically a suite of integrated applications—that an organization can use to collect, store, manage, and interpret data from these many business activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        ERP provides an integrated and continuously updated view of core business processes using common databases maintained by a database management system. ERP systems track business resources—cash, raw materials, production capacity—and the status of business commitments: orders, purchase orders, and payroll.
    </p>

        ERP software is important because it can facilitate the following:
    </p>
    <ul><li>Increase effective communication between departments</li><li>Allow employees to access information they need from anywhere</li><li>Streamline processes across various department</li><li>Provide a birds eye view of a business&#39; overall operations</li><li>Better manage a company&#39;s finances</li></ul>
    <p>
        These benefits lead to higher productivity, more efficient operations, and reduced errors.<br />ERP can be beneficial from a marketing standpoint because it helps you see how your business is doing as a whole, revealing areas of opportunity where improvements can be made. ERP provides valuable data and analytics that will help you understand your customers better and will give you insight that you can use to tailor your marketing strategy. It also makes it easier to communicate effectively with your customers and provide better customer service.
