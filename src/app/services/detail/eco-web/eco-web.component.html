        How development drives eCommerce success
    </h2>
    <p>
        eCommerce businesses know that user experience and revenue go hand in hand. When users find shopping hard, slow, or confusing, they don&rsquo;t convert and you don&rsquo;t get paid.
    </p>
    <p>
        That&rsquo;s why your eCommerce site should be working hard for you &ndash; streamlining your business and making shopping effortless. But without a well-developed site, you&rsquo;re trying to build a great experience on shaky foundations.

    <h2>
        Pillars of a great eCommerce experience
    </h2>
    <p>
        An eCommerce site is not just another website. Multiple business-critical elements need to be executed properly in order to ensure a strong return on your investment. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>A seamless shopping experience. </strong>An eCommerce build must make shopping easy and secure. Pages must load quickly and reliably, with a consistent look and feel, compelling content, and search functionality that meets users&rsquo; needs and expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The right integrations. </strong>A static site that&rsquo;s disconnected from your business ecosystem creates data entry work for employees, and irritates customers with out-of-date information and limited features.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Interaction and personalization.</strong> Customers expect sites to &ldquo;remember&rdquo; them with features such as product recommendations, promos, and a tailored, content-rich experience. And as a customer-facing channel, the richest eCommerce experiences offer ready access to real-time support such as live chat.
